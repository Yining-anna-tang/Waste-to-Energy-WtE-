📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the empirical materials, variable documentation, and analytical framework for the study:
“Bureaucrat Incentives Embedded in Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Combustion Enhance Local Government Performance Competitiveness.”
China leads global waste-to-energy (WtE) capacity expansion, accounting for approximately 38.4%–50.0% of total installed capacity worldwide. Unlike existing studies that emphasize technical efficiency or carbon reduction outcomes, this project investigates the political and institutional consequences of embedding WtE expansion into bureaucratic performance evaluation systems.
Drawing on:
A nationally representative survey dataset (CGSS 2021, n = 8,148)
A supplementary experimental dataset (n = 1,711)
Configurational causal analysis (fsQCA)
we examine how perceived environmental improvement enhances:
Government environmental governance satisfaction (SGEG)
Local government performance competitiveness
Bureaucratic political competitiveness under promotion-based incentive systems
Our findings show that visible environmental improvements strengthen perceived governance performance, and that perceived social equity (SEP) amplifies this effect.

🎯 Research Questions
Does perceived environmental improvement enhance local government performance competitiveness?
Do bureaucratic incentives embedded in WtE combustion strengthen public evaluations of governance?
Does perceived social equity amplify the relationship between environmental improvement and government performance?
What combinations of environmental, behavioral, and cognitive factors jointly produce high government competitiveness?

🧪 Research Design
Study 1: National Survey Analysis (CGSS 2021)
Dataset: China General Social Survey (CGSS 2021)
Sample size: 8,148 respondents
Method: Machine learning + regression analysis
Goal: Examine how perceived environmental improvement affects SGEG
Study 2: WtE Experimental Context
Platform: Credamo online experimental platform
Sample size: 1,711 respondents
Context: Waste-to-Energy governance scenario
Goal: Identify causal interpretation in WtE-specific environmental perception
Study 3: Configurational Analysis (fsQCA)
Groups: T1–T4
Method: Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis
Goal: Identify causal configurations leading to high SGEG

🧠 Theoretical Contributions
This study offers three major contributions:
Political Incentive Perspective on WtE Expansion
Moves beyond efficiency analysis to examine how bureaucratic performance evaluation systems embed environmental infrastructure into political promotion mechanisms.
Environmental Visibility and Political Competitiveness
Demonstrates that visible environmental improvement strengthens perceived local government competitiveness.
Interaction of Equity and Governance Performance
Identifies social equity perception as a key moderating factor that amplifies environmental governance evaluation.
