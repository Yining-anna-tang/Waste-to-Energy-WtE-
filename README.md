📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the empirical materials, variable documentation, and analytical framework for the study:
“Bureaucrat Incentives Embedded in Waste-to-Energy (WtE) Combustion Enhance Local Government Performance Competitiveness.”
China leads global waste-to-energy (WtE) capacity expansion, accounting for approximately 38.4%–50.0% of total installed capacity worldwide. Unlike existing studies that emphasize technical efficiency or carbon reduction outcomes, this project investigates the political and institutional consequences of embedding WtE expansion into bureaucratic performance evaluation systems.

Drawing on:
A nationally representative survey dataset (CGSS 2021, n = 8,148)
A supplementary experimental dataset (n = 1,711)
Configurational causal analysis (fsQCA)
we examine how perceived environmental improvement enhances:
Government environmental governance satisfaction (SGEG)
Local government performance competitiveness
Bureaucratic political competitiveness under promotion-based incentive systems
Our findings show that visible environmental improvements strengthen perceived governance performance, and that perceived social equity (SEP) amplifies this effect.

🎯 Research Questions
Does perceived environmental improvement enhance local government performance competitiveness?
Do bureaucratic incentives embedded in WtE combustion strengthen public evaluations of governance?
Does perceived social equity amplify the relationship between environmental improvement and government performance?
What combinations of environmental, behavioral, and cognitive factors jointly produce high government competitiveness?

🧪 Research Design
Study 1: National Survey Analysis (CGSS 2021)
Dataset: China General Social Survey (CGSS 2021)
Sample size: 8,148 respondents
Method: Machine learning + regression analysis

Study 2: WtE Experimental Context
Platform: Credamo online experimental platform
Sample size: 1,711 respondents
Context: Waste-to-Energy governance scenario
Goal: Identify causal interpretation in WtE-specific environmental perception
Study 3: Configurational Analysis (fsQCA)
Groups: T1–T4
Method: Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis
Goal: Identify causal configurations leading to high SGEG

🧠 Theoretical Contributions
This study offers three major contributions:
Political Incentive Perspective on WtE Expansion
Moves beyond efficiency analysis to examine how bureaucratic performance evaluation systems embed environmental infrastructure into political promotion mechanisms.
Environmental Visibility and Political Competitiveness
Demonstrates that visible environmental improvement strengthens perceived local government competitiveness.
Interaction of Equity and Governance Performance
Identifies social equity perception as a key moderating factor that amplifies environmental governance evaluation.

🛠 Methodological Framework
Machine learning models
SHAP interpretability analysis
Regression and interaction models
fsQCA configurational causality analysis
Likert-scale measurement operationalization

🔬 Policy Implications
Environmental infrastructure can function as a political signaling mechanism.
Visible environmental gains enhance bureaucratic promotion competitiveness.
Equity perception is critical for sustaining public support.
WtE governance effectiveness depends not only on technical performance but also on political incentive alignment.

📎 Data Availability
CGSS datasets are publicly available via the official CGSS website two years after completion.
Experimental data collected via Credamo platform (access subject to project approval).
